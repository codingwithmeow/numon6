1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Molecular analysis of liquids and solids and all raw materials and products 

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:11:52
that are part of the food value chain is performed using infrared photonic spectroscopy 

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.150
components which were previously analyzed using large machines with high energy expenditure 

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.440
are analyzed with much less energy with this technology 

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.530
and not only the outer surfaces of fruits vegetables or raw materials but also their interiors

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.230
are subjected to analysis in this way the products are tracked both when we are included in

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:41.550
the production chain from the growing process that begins underground to the steps of collecting the from the field.
