00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.966
Important decisions are made every day in production

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.600
lines and factories where there are multiple machines and systems.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.233
Problems include complex dashboards and data with potential errors compiled into

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:16.166
potential errors compiled into unstructured files, as well

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:21.033
as long meetings and wasted time to maintain operations.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.766
While employees and operations managers often spend their working hours in the office,

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.800
availability to work in the field, which is very important,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.833
is not always possible.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.366
Thanks to virtual engineers, collecting operational data, detecting problems,

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.366
consolidating production, maintenance and quality while communicating with them through

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:45.800
communication channels facilitates all processes.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.133
Our 4 main virtual engineers are in the fields of production, maintenance, quality control and supply chain.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.366
Thanks to virtual engineers connected to all communication channels 24/7, our system is proactive

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:02.666
and sends alerts when needed through interconnected platforms.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:08.766
Our system communicates the issues and requests appropriate steps for further action.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:16.533
Our team of virtual engineers also organizes meetings between working units and provides service 24/7 in the appropriate language.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.400
Virtual engineers save businesses time and money by constantly learning,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.233
make processes more efficient in every aspect, and work in more than 30 languages.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.733
Just like our solution, which works independently of brand, model and device,

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.066
it adapts to every system and process, regardless of the size or level of digitalization.
